      <li>1 tablespoon vegetable oil</li>
      <li>cooking spray</li>
      <li>1/3 cup less-sodium soy sauce</li>
      <li>3 tablespoons rice vinegar</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons honey</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon fresh ginger</li>
      <li>3 cloves garlic, minced</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon toasted sesame oil</li>
      <li>1/4 teaspoon crushed red pepper</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon cornstarch</li>
      <li>2 cups hot cooked white rice</li>
      <li>toasted sesame seeds, for garnish</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Directions</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Preheat air fryer to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).</li>
      <li>
        Toss together beef, broccoli, bell pepper, white parts of green onions,
        and vegetable oil in a large bowl. Coat air fryer basket with cooking
        spray. Arrange meat mixture in basket.
      </li>
      <li>
        Cook for about 5 minutes. Stir and keep cooking until meat has reached
        desired doneness, e.g. 145 degrees F (62 degrees C) for medium, 6 to 8
        minutes. Remove meat mixture and let stand for about 5 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Meanwhile, for sauce, stir together soy sauce, vinegar, honey, ginger,
        garlic, sesame oil, and crushed red pepper in a small saucepan. Bring to
        a boil, reduce heat, and simmer, uncovered, until liquid is reduced to
        1/2 cup, about 10 minutes. Whisk together cornstarch and 1 tablespoon
        water in a small bowl. Stir into the sauce and cook, stirring
        constantly, until thickened, about 1 minute.
      </li>
      <li>
        Toss beef and vegetables with sauce in a serving dish. Top with
        remaining green onions. Serve with rice and garnish with sesame seeds.
