      <li>1/2 cup sugar</li>
      <li>1 ounce dark chocolate, chopped, plus more for garnish</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Brown Butter Frosting</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>5 tablespoons butter</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons honey</li>
      <li>1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
      <li>3/4 cup powdered sugar</li>
      <li>2 teaspoons water, or as needed</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Directions</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Preheat air fryer to 320 degrees F (160 degrees C). Coat a 6-inch cake
        pan with cooking spray. Line bottom of pan with parchment paper; dust
        with 2 tablespoons flour, tapping out excess.
      </li>
      <li>
        Stir together 1/4 cup flour, the cocoa, baking powder, baking soda, and
        salt in a small bowl. In another small bowl, whisk together buttermilk,
        applesauce, oil, espresso powder, and vanilla.
      </li>
      <li>
        In a third bowl, beat egg with an electric mixer at low speed. Gradually
        add sugar. Increase mixer speed to high and continue beating until
        mixture is thick and pale, about 2 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Alternately fold flour mixture and buttermilk mixture into egg mixture
        with a rubber spatula, stirring until incorporated before adding next
        addition. Fold in dark chocolate.
      </li>
      <li>
        Pour batter into the prepared pan. Arrange pan in the air fryer basket.
      </li>
      <li>
        Cook until a toothpick inserted in center comes out clean, about 25
        minutes. Let cool in pan on a wire rack about 10 minutes. Remove cake
        from pan and allow to cool completely on a wire rack.
      </li>
      <li>
        For the frosting, melt butter in a heavy saucepan over medium heat;
        cook, stirring occasionally, until butter begins to turn golden brown
        and smells nutty, 15 to 20 minutes. Transfer butter to a bowl; cool for
        10 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Whisk in honey and vanilla. Whisk in powdered sugar until smooth, adding
        water, 1 teaspoon at a time, until desired consistency. The frosting
        will look separated but will come together with whisking in water a
        little at a time.
      </li>
      <li>
        Immediately top cooled cake with the frosting and garnish with
        additional dark chocolate.
      </li>
